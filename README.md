# OpenGL-Programming - Space Objects

<h4>A Little About the Program</h4>

<p>I enjoy games and astronomy. I thought my final summer - class - project could revolve around those things. The program can defintely be improved, with better keyboard functions (as the main keyboard functions in this program revolve around 2 planets, not all of them). I can add more space objects, aircrafts, aliens eventually and turn this in into a little game!</p>
<br>
<p>I built the program using Xcode, C++, and OpenGL Utilities. The code headers can be slightly modified so it can run on Visual Studio. </p>
